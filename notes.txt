Things I'm learning

Wrapping a list of tupples with dict() turns them into a dictionary

a = [("Daniel", 23), ("Ronnie", 20]
dict(a) gives a dictionary, cool

to declare a tuple with only onle element, use a comma

a = (4,)

Gotta be careful with all those nested returns, can gives funny errors

Attempted to pass a dict for a group of keyword arguments, but this got thrown into args, so kwargs has to be passed one by one.
