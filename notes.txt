Things I'm learning

Wrapping a list of tupples with dict() turns them into a dictionary

a = [("Daniel", 23), ("Ronnie", 20]
dict(a) gives a dictionary, cool

to declare a tuple with only onle element, use a comma

a = (4,)

Gotta be careful with all those nested returns, can gives funny errors

Attempted to pass a dict for a group of keyword arguments, but this got thrown into args, so kwargs has to be passed one by one.

warning is not working when the category of Deprecation warning is passed

still don't know what's going with caching in a decorator. If a decorator is called everytime, aren't the variables being reassigned everytime?

Man, super annoyed at that decorator stuff on memoization

time to do exercises
